# 🚗 Automobile Speed/Distance Tracker

This programming project involves creating a C++ program that simulates the speed of a car and calculates the distance traveled over a period of time. Accepts keyboard input from the user and produces text output on the console.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** C++11


Commands: "a" (accelerate) command increase the speed by 5 miles per hour (MPH) over a time interval of 1 second. Similarly, the “b” (brake) command decreases the speed by 5 MPH over a time interval of 1 second, and the “c” (cruise) command keeps the speed constant for a time interval of 1 second. “d” (demo) command outputs a sequence of steps, where each step in the sequence represents one “time interval”. "h" command to print a menu of commands avaliable
